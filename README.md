# recipeMe

This is an app I made in order to learn a little bit of web development. From this project, I learned javascript, NodeJs and mongoDB. I built this in goormide. You are able to create accounts and add recipes to the website. This project is has a simple understanding of user data such as creating accounts, accounts who don't own other recipes aren't allowed to edit them and you are able to leave comments. Overall I found this project to be a fun way to learn web development. 

Also you will need to download the node_modules needed for this project. In package.json, it has all the modules and versions you will need. Thank you! 

### Running recipeMe
Open a new terminal window to run mongo DB. Then type 'mongod' to start mongo DB

```
mongod
```

Then in a different window type 'node app.js' to start the website. TIP: If you would like some sample data, uncomment seedDB() on line 31. This will generate some sample data. 

```
node app.js
```
